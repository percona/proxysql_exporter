Prometheus exporter for [ProxySQL](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql) performance data.
Supported versions: 1.2 and 1.3.

## Building and running

### Building

```bash
make
```

### Running

The MySQL server's data source name must be set via the `DATA_SOURCE_NAME` environment variable. The format of this
variable is described at https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name.

To enable HTTP basic authentication, set environment variable `HTTP_AUTH` to user:password pair. Alternatively, you can
use YAML file with `server_user` and `server_password` fields.

```bash
export DATA_SOURCE_NAME='stats:stats@tcp(127.0.0.1:42004)/'
export HTTP_AUTH='user:password'
./proxysql_exporter <flags>
```

Note, using `stats` user requires ProxySQL 1.2.4 or higher. Otherwise, use `admin` user.

## Visualizing

There is a Grafana dashboard for ProxySQL available as a part of [PMM](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html) project, you can see the demo [here](https://pmmdemo.percona.com/graph/d/proxysql-instance-summary/proxysql-instance-summary).

## Submitting Bug Reports

If you find a bug in Percona ProxySQL Exporter or one of the related projects, you should submit a report to that project's [JIRA](https://jira.percona.com) issue tracker.

Your first step should be [to search](https://jira.percona.com/issues/?jql=project=PMM%20AND%20component=ProxySQL_Exporter) the existing set of open tickets for a similar report. If you find that someone else has already reported your problem, then you can upvote that report to increase its visibility.

If there is no existing report, submit a report following these steps:

1. [Sign in to Percona JIRA.](https://jira.percona.com/login.jsp) You will need to create an account if you do not have one.
2. [Go to the Create Issue screen and select the relevant project.](https://jira.percona.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=11600&issuetype=1&priority=3&components=11601)
3. Fill in the fields of Summary, Description, Steps To Reproduce, and Affects Version to the best you can. If the bug is due to a crash, attach the stack trace from the logs.

An excellent resource is [Elika Etemad's article on filing good bug reports.](https://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/).

As a general rule of thumb, please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing tickets.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.
